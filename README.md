// clock project


    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    
    This project entailed using the time function within the C++ libraries to allow a user to view the current time in a 12 hour or 24 hour time format using a digital clock. I added a menu to allow the user to add either a second, minute or hour as well to the current time and once the user has selected which time component they wanted to add to, the program would then display the current time with their selection.
    
    What did you do particularly well?
    
    I believe something I did well was organize the code well allowing someone else who wanted to read the code to do so easily. I used white space efficiently and added comments allowing someone to understand what each function performed. 
    
    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    
    I think I could have added a header class as well with a function class to allow the main class (which currently has all the code) to look more professional. I think these improvements might make the code somewhat more appealing to review for someone who has a greater knowledge using C++.
    
    Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
    
    I found this to be quite challenging at first, but I was able to overcome areas I was having trouble in by utilizing examples from Stack Overflow as well with reaching out to my instructor regarding the differences with each time function the C++ libraries have to offer. 
    
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
    
    I think some of the skills acquired from this project entail learning how to utilize the resources available to me and knowing what kind of questions to ask for helping me comprehend what I am writing as well with how to plan out projects for future courses I will take. 
    
    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    
    I followed the project guidelines as well with the information from our text to make sure the code was written in a proper manner. I believe I did so well which would allow someone else who has a good bit of knowledge regarding C++ to follow along with the code with relative ease.
